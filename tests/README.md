# Pybricks MicroPython tests

Currently, the tests in the `virtualhub` folder are automated
while the remaining folders contain tests that must be run manually.

Use `./test-virtualhub.sh` in the top-level directory to run the automated tests
for virtualhub.

Use `--list-test` to list tests or `--include <regex>` to run single tests.

Use `--clean-failures` to remove previous failure logs.
