/**
 * \defgroup clock Clock library
 *
 * The clock library is the interface between Contiki and the platform
 * specific clock functionality. The clock library defines a macro,
 * CLOCK_SECOND, to convert seconds into the tick resolution of the platform.
 * Typically this is 1-10 milliseconds, e.g. 4*CLOCK_SECOND could be 512.
 * A 16 bit counter would thus overflow every 1-10 minutes.
 * Platforms use the tick interrupt to maintain a long term count
 * of seconds since startup.
 *
 * Platforms may also implement rtimers for greater time resolution
 * and for real-time interrupts, These use a corresponding RTIMER_SECOND.
 *
 * \note These timers do not necessarily have a common divisor or are phase locked.
 * One may be crystal controlled and the other may not. Low power operation
 * or sleep will often use one for wake and disable the other, then give
 * it a tick correction after wakeup.
 *
 * \note The clock library need in many cases not be used
 * directly. Rather, the \ref timer "timer library", \ref etimer
 * "event timers", or \ref rtimer "rtimer library" should be used.
 *
 * \sa \ref timer "Timer library"
 * \sa \ref etimer "Event timers"
 * \sa \ref rtimer "Realtime library"
