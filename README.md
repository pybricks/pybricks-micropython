# Pybricks

Pybricks brings Python-like coding to programmable LEGO bricks, and transforms
remote-controlled smart hubs into truly autonomous robots.

Pybricks builds on [MicroPython][micropython/micropython], which is an efficient
Python implementation that runs on microcontrollers. Pybricks expands
MicroPython with new powerful drivers for LEGO devices
including motors and sensors. It also adds the `pybricks` package, which makes
it easy for end-users to access those devices and all the features of the smart
hubs.

# Supported Programmable Bricks & Hubs

## Released

- *LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3*: The community-supported version comes preinstalled
with the latest [ev3dev][ev3dev-snapshot] image. LEGO Education has also
  tested and approved the 2.0 release, which is available through
  [their website][lego-education-ev3-micropython].

## Ready for beta users
- *LEGO Technic Hub* (`TechnicHub`): Try it now
with [Pybricks Code][Pybricks Code].

## In progress

- LEGO BOOST Move Hub (`MoveHub`): Although not all hub features are supported
  yet, this firmware already runs well. External sensors are not yet supported.
- LEGO City Hub (`CityHub`): Same as `MoveHub`. Bluetooth is not enabled yet,
which means that it's not ready for everyday users yet.

## Under consideration

- LEGO Education SPIKE Prime Hub (`PrimeHub`): This hub is even more powerful
than the other new hubs listed above. If we support it, we will first focus on
functionality shared with the others, like motors and sensors. Other
SPIKE-specific functionality like the light matrix or Bluetooth classic will be
saved for later. We recommend that beginning users start with the official LEGO
apps. Read more about the
differences [here](#differences-with-lego-education-spike-prime-micropython).

## What's next?

We hope that LEGO continues to develop new smart hubs. As long as its firmware
can be upgraded, there's a good chance that Pybricks will support that hub in
the near future.

# Development

Most Pybricks users will not need to do anything with this source code. We
provide pre-built firmware files with every release on
our site, [pybricks.com].

But since you're reading this, you might be interested in building the code
yourself, or start tweaking and hacking. We don't have step-by-step guides
for installing all the developer tools just yet.

## Pybricks and Upstream MicroPython

The Pybricks authors are actively contributing to upstream MicroPython instead of forking it into
a whole new project. In essence, Pybricks just adds a family of `ports`.

To streamline development and releases, we do maintain a fork of `micropython`
[here][pybricks/micropython]. This adds a few minor patches that haven't made
it upstream yet. Every once in a while, that repository gets rebased with all
the latest and greatest that upstream [`micropython`][micropython/micropython]
has to offer.

Summing up:

- [`pybricks/pybricks-micropython`][pybricks-micropython]: Main repo for all
  Pybricks firmware. This has a continuous master branch.
- [`pybricks/micropython`][pybricks/micropython]: fork of
  [upstream MicroPython][micropython/micropython] that is included as a
  submodule in the main `pybricks-micropython` repository. This gets occasionally rebased.


## Cloning

This project uses submodules. However we don't recommend using the
`--recursive` option of `git` since it will clone unnecessary dependencies.
Instead, the required submodules will be automatically cloned the first time
you run `make`.

    git clone https://github.com/pybricks/pybricks-micropython

## What about all the other repositories?
Pybricks includes not just firmware for each LEGO hub, but also various tools,
documentation, and fun projects. Here's an overview of the other repositories:

- [`pybricks-api`][pybricks-api]: This is the Pybricks user API. It documents
  the `pybricks` package that comes preinstalled in our firmware. This
  repository doesn't contain any real code. The real package is written in C
  and baked into the firmware. This repo just helps us design and document the
  user Python API without getting into too much implementation details. Don't
  want to build it? View the web version [here][docs].
- [`pybricks-projects`][pybricks-projects]: This is a broad
  collection of end-user MicroPython scripts that you can run! This includes
  example snippets and projects for official LEGO models and custom made ones.

## What about the other stuff in /bricks?

Like MicroPython, Pybricks can run on just about every device that lets
you update the firmware. And we could not resist doing just that, so there's
more than just the bricks above. But getting to a point where it is easy to
use for everyday users takes quite a bit more work,
so not all bricks in `/bricks` will be supported officially for now.

# How can I help?
If you've got a Technic Hub, the best way to help right now is to try out the
beta release of [Pybricks Code][Pybricks Code]. Much of its code is shared
with the other hubs. So if you share your findings or issues, we can fix them
for all hubs at once, including for the ones that are not released yet!
