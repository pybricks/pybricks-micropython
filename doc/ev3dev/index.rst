Using MicroPython with LEGO\ :sup:`®` MINDSTORMS\ :sup:`®` EV3
==============================================================

This guide shows you how to get started writing MicroPython programs for your
LEGO® MINDSTORMS® EV3 robots. You'll learn to do so in two steps:

- :doc:`Installation <startinstall>`: First you'll prepare your computer and
  your EV3 Brick by collecting and installing the required tools. You'll also learn
  how to turn the EV3 Brick on and off and to navigate the menu on the screen.

- :doc:`Creating and running programs <startrun>`: Next, you'll learn how to
  create a program and download it to the EV3 Brick. You'll also learn how to
  start that program from your computer or from the EV3 Brick.

After you've run the first demo program, you'll be ready to try out the example
programs and start inventing your own programs.
